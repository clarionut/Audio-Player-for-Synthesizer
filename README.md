# Audio Player for Synthesizer

An audio player for a modular synthesizer based on a cheap 'Kebidu music speakers' module with FM radio, USB, micro SD, Bluetooth and aux-in modes.
This was inspired by the [Tesseract Modular 'Low Coast'](https://www.tesseractmodular.com/eurorack-modules/low-coast/) module which simply provides two
Eurorack-level outputs, one for each of the stereo channels of the module.

This version also provides a mono mix output and has trigger inputs for the transport controls - play/pause, next station/track & previous station/track.
